  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/TESTMYhtmlFILES/iNFO/cincisprezece.txt
    - assets/Student UBB-black.flr
    - assets/Student UBB-white.flr
    - assets/svg/

    - assets/logo.png
    - assets/alucard.jpg
    - assets/tick.png
    - assets/avatar.png
    - assets/backdrop.png
    - assets/video1_thumb.png
    - assets/video4_thumb.png
    - assets/video3_thumb.png
    - assets/video2_thumb.png
  fonts:

      fonts:
        - asset: assets/Nunito.ttf
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
